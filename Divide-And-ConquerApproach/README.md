# Divide and Conquer Solution for Generalized Tower of Hanoi

This solution uses a divide and conquer approach to solve the generalized Tower of Hanoi problem with four pegs, based on the Frame-Stewart algorithm.

## Algorithm

The Frame-Stewart algorithm divides the problem into manageable parts, moving subsets of disks among the available pegs and minimizing the total number of moves.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run this solution:

```bash
g++ -o dnc_solution dnc_solution.cpp
./dnc_solution
